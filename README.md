# Goal
Build a Tic Tac Toe game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript on your own. 

I commit the solution to every round each week until the project has been finished.

## Finished Project

# Overview Challenges
## CHALLENGE #01 - Tasks üõ°Ô∏è
- Create the first part of your Tic Tac Toe game (compare screenshots in "CHALLENGE #01 - Outcome üõ°Ô∏è").
- Create a centered & responsive UI with the tool of your choice (flexbox, grid, media query, or other options, whatever you already know).
- Create 2 Input fields for player 1 and player 2
- Create a submit button to save the names of the players into variables.
- Check if all players have a name entered. If not, alert the user with a warning and don't start the game.
- If all names are entered, let the submission of names pass and show a blank screen with the title only.

- Hints: :wink:
- Think simple.
- You want the same fonts? I used google fonts: Kings, Outfit & Hubballi
- The colors are "deeppink" and "deepskyblue"

## CHALLENGE #02 - Tasks üõ°Ô∏è
- Create your 2nd Part of the Tic Tac Toe Game (compare screenshots below).
- Create a centered & responsive GameBoard with the tool of your choice (flexbox, grid, media query, or other options, whatever you already know or prefer).
- The board consists of 9 fields (3x3) and follows the rules of tic-tac-toe.
- The background color of each cell is ‚Äûdeepskyblue‚Äú.
- Make each cell clickable. Mark it with the symbol of the player‚Äôs turn ("X‚Äú or ‚ÄûO‚Äú whoever‚Äôs turn it is)
- Make occupied cells not clickable again and also not progressing the game,
- Player 1 always begins with X.
- Display interactively the player‚Äôs turn with these phrases for each player: 1st "'player1Name', you are up!", then every even: "'player2Name', now you!", every odd ‚ÄûYour turn, 'player1Name'!"
- Don‚Äôt build in a winning checking algorithm yet. This is part of the next challenge.
- Make a button that clears the board, so you can start over the game without entering new names.
- If you refresh the page, it will land on the player names input scene.
  
- Hints: :wink:
- Think simple.
- You will query and manipluate the DOM very often [Read More About How DOM-Manipulation works](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/html-dom-guide-for-everyone-ec07fdca93a1)
- Try to avoid the Tag <table> it makes more problems in terms of responsiveness than it solves
